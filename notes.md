# Project Notes

## 2024-11-09

- Got the right intersections and normals, but wrong sun direction and therefore wrong everything else
- Fixed sun direction - it's normalized direction w.r.t. eye it turns out.
- Still not working: sRGB final values are off compared to what the examples say.

### TODO

- Shadows are appearing in the wrong places
- Final values for sRGB are still a bit off
